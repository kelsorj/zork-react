Used Cursor to build a react-app version of Zork I based on the map below. I think there are several things that aren't identical to the original version but it'd
be great if other people could work on debugging and enhancing this version.

Ideally it will ultimately work with this walkthrough


walkthrough from https://struckus.tripod.com/Zork1walk.htm

As can be expected, this Walkthrough is a spoiler for the game.  Please only use this as a last resort if you get stuck, and try not to read ahead of where you are in the game.

I can tell you from experience that I enjoyed this game much more by playing through it without any help than if I had just looked up the answers.

Throughout this walkthrough, I'll be putting things in Quotes, (" ") this means to type in exactly what you read there.  Some solutions are simple to come up with, but only accepted in one grammatical form.

If you get lost, please refer to the Maps on the previous page.

Take into account...

This is not the only way to play this game.  I have taken the 'direct' approach to completing the game, and with that in mind, you won't be going to every room on the map.

bullet	
One problem with this game is the Thief (I.E. Footpad) He is a non-constant variable in the game.  He does what he wants and shows up randomly.  The best approach is to leave any room that he shows up in IMMEDIATELY.  Always remember that whatever he takes from you, you will be getting back later in the game.

Let's begin shall we.

Upper World
You begin this game on the west side of the historical White House of Quendor.

Go South, then East.

Open the window and enter the house.

Kitchen
Go west into the Living room

Living Room
The Living room is the only place that you can safely leave anything you find.  If you drop any item anywhere else in the game, there is a chance that the thief will take it and move it somewhere else.  Keep in mind that this is only items that you have seen.
Take the Lamp, move the rug and open the trapdoor.

Go down.

Cellar
Someone shuts and locks the trapdoor behind you, you won't ever find out who is doing this, so don't worry about it.  Personally, I think Either Marc Blank or Dave Liebling are hiding in the Living Room somewhere (behind a firewall maybe...) and are doing this just to screw with the players.
Turn on the Lamp, Go South, then East to the Gallery

Gallery
Take the Painting and go North to the Studio.

Studio
 You can only fit up the chimney with the lamp and one other item. (I.E. two items)
Go Up the Chimney.

Kitchen
Go Upstairs to the Attic.

Attic
Take the knife and the rope.

Go back down through the kitchen and into the Living Room.

Living Room
All of the treasures you find must be placed in the case here in the living room to count towards your total.
Open the Case and put the painting inside.

Drop the knife and take the sword.

Open the trapdoor and descend once again.

Cellar
Once again, someone closes the trapdoor and locks it.  This will continue to happen until you discover another way out of the Underground. (The chimney doesn't count)
Save your game, as we're going to one of the random battle sequences in the game.

Walk North into the Troll Room

Troll Room
Note that your sword glows blue in the presence of danger.
The only way past the troll is to kill him.

"Kill Troll with Sword"

Continue to "Kill Troll with Sword" until he dies. 

Drop your sword.  (You won't need it anymore)

Walk East, East, then South-East to get to the Dome Room.

Dome Room
Tie the rope to the railing

Climb down the rope to the Torch Room

Torch Room
Go South, then East to the Egyptian Room

Egyptian Room
Take the Coffin (Sarcophagus)

Go West and then South to the Altar.

Altar
 There's no way you're going to get down that hole with the coffin, and even the program will tell
you that you haven't got a prayer. That's a hint, folks.
"Pray" at the altar, and you'll be above ground, in the forest.

Forest
Turn your lamp off.

Walk South then North (I know , I know, Call the writers and complain.  It all makes sense on the maps, I swear!) to the Forest Clearing, and then East to reach the Canyon View.

Canyon View
Climb all the way down to the bottom.

Canyon (Bottom)
Drop the coffin and open it.

Take the Scepter and wave it in the air to solidify the rainbow.

"Look" and you'll see a Pot of Gold on the ground.

Take the Pot of Gold and The Coffin.

Walk South-West and Climb all the way back up to the Canyon View.

Canyon View
Go Northwest to the Clearing, and then West to the Window where you'll reenter the house.

Kitchen
Open the bag and take the Garlic.

Go into the Living Room.

Living Room
Put your treasures into the case.

Save the game, and get some food (Not the food in the game) we've got a lot of traveling to do.

Open the Trapdoor, turn the lamp on and go back down.

Cellar
You should notice that the door doesn't close this time.  The Altar Prayer counts as another way out of the Underground.
Go North, East, North, North-East, and then East to reach the Dam, then Go North into the Dam Lobby.

Dam Lobby
Take the Matches, then walk either North or East into the Maintenance Room. (it doesn't matter)

Maintenance Room
Take the Wrench and the Screwdriver.

Push the Yellow Button and return the the Dam.

Flood Control Dam #3
Notice that the Green Bubble is now lit.

Head back through the Coal Mine to reach the Ladder Bottom.

Go West to the Timber Room.

Ignore the Broken Timber, it's only use is to use as a reference point when you return here in Zork III.

Squeeze through the crack to the West into the Drafty Room.

Open the Lid and take the Diamond.

Go North and put the torch and Diamond back in the basket, the continue to the East back to the Timber Room.

Reservoir South
Go East to the Dam, and East again to the Dam Base.

Dam Base
There's a pile of plastic on the ground here, it's a Frobozz Magic Inflatable boat.  One thing to think about is: If your carrying anything sharp, you need to place it in the boat before you board it or it will puncture the boat.
Inflate the pile of plastic with the Air Pump.

Board the Boat. (Read the instruction label if you like)

Say, "Launch"

Cellar.
Go North to the Troll Room, and West into the BIG Maze of this game.

Go South, East, and Up to reach the remains of another hapless Adventurer.

Adventurer's Remains
Do NOT touch the skeleton!
Take the Bag of Coins, and the Key.

Go South-West, East, South, and then South-East you will be in the Cyclops Room.

Cyclops Room
There are several ways to deal with the Cyclops.  The other way is to bring the sack of food and the bottle of water from the Kitchen and feed him. It will put him to sleep.  That way, you won't get the new passage to the Living Room though.
Type, "Ulysses" (or Odysseus)

At the sound of his former master's name, the Cyclops will run away and break through the door in the Living room. (I guess that WASN'T the front door after all.)

Unlock and open the Grate. (Watch for falling leaves)

Go Up into the Forest Clearing.

Forest Clearing
Go South to the Big Tree.

Big Tree
Climb the Tree and wind up the canary that's inside the Egg.

Climb down the tree.

Take the Bauble the songbird drops.

There is now a Stone Barrow open near here.
Enter the Stone Barrow and Prepare yourself for Zork II.


You didn't really think it would end there, did you? Not when there's still Zork II and Zork III waiting for you up ahead! Ah, but it's too late; you can't turn back now! You'll just have to grit your teeth and follow through to the end (with a little help, of course...) 
See you in Zork II!
